Falling for his charms, she plans to confess her love to him when she gets recorded by her friend being rejected and made fun of. Being depressed about becoming a laughing stock and having an ugly face inherited from her mother, Lim Joo Gyung decides to jump off the building but backs away as she realises, she does not want to die. Just as she is about to back off, Lee Su Ho (Cha Eun Woo) pulls her back, knocking the glasses from her face. Unable to see, and stumbling down the stairs due to out-of-order elevator, Lee Su Ho decides to help her by carrying her on his back. Lim Joo Gyung safely returns home to a ruckus, while crying, asks her family as to why she doesn’t have her fathers looks. In her room, she questions online, as to how to become beautiful. Amongst many suggestions, someone recommends make up. She tries it by going online and looking at various videos, but ultimately fails as she shows up to school with a horrible make up that gets her more made fun of. Coming back to online, the second time she finally gets various commentators to recommend her products and techniques, and is able to pull off a face changing make up. Now with a make up that makes her “beautiful” and a new school in which Lee Su Ho also attends, she starts a new life with a new face, leaving behind her “ugly face” home."
